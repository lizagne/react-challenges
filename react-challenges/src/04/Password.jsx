//Create a component <Password label="Password"> that contains an <input> with a <label>. 

//Inside a <SignUp minimumLength={ 12 }> component put two <Password> components: one should have the label "Password" and the other "Confirm Password". 

//Both <Password> components should have a red border unless they are longer than minimumLength and match each other.
